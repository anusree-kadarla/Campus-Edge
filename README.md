#Minor Project
# Campus-Edge

This project involves the development of a mobile application that provides a platform for students to access a variety of educational materials and information. The application will consist of two modules â€“ a User Module and an Admin Module. The User Module will enable students to view eBooks, view attendance, view faculty information, browse course offerings, and view images of school events. The Admin Module, on the other hand, will provide administrators with the ability to update eBooks, modify faculty information, upload and delete notices, and manage other aspects of the application. The app will be built using flutter and firebase to ensure seamless functionality and user experience. The User Module will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with easy-to-navigate menus and features. The Admin Module will have secure login credentials and will be accessible only to authorized personnel. The overall goal of the application is to provide a comprehensive platform for students to access relevant information and educational materials, while also enabling administrators to manage and update the content of the application as needed.
